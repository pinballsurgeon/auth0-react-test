# High-Level Business Objectives

## OBJECTIVE-1: Domain Knowledge Visualization Platform

**VISION**: Create an intuitive, beautiful, and dynamic 3D visualization platform that helps users explore complex domains through animated, interactive visualizations powered by LLMs and D3.

**CORE FUNCTIONALITY**:
1. Users input a domain query (e.g., "cars", "planets", "programming languages")
2. System retrieves domain members via LLM (e.g., Toyota Camry, Ferrari 488)
3. System identifies key attributes for comparison via LLM (e.g., speed, cost, popularity)
4. System rates each member across all attributes via LLM
5. System applies PCA to position members in 3D space based on similarity
6. System retrieves and applies appropriate imagery to 3D objects
7. Users can interactively explore the domain through an intuitive 3D interface

**KEY COMPONENTS**:
- **WorkflowEngine**: Orchestrates the asynchronous processing pipeline
- **Visualization System**: Renders 3D interactive space with D3
- **DevPanel**: Internal tool for monitoring, testing, and validating workflow modules
